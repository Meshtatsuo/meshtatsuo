Hello! My name is Dominic Misasi, and I am a full stack developer based out of Nampa, Idaho. 

After graduating college in 2016, I worked various odd jobs while freelancing as a sound engineer and audio programmer on the side. My experience designing audio systems for games motivated me to go back to school and learn what it takes to be a full stack developer. During school I built several web applications, including:

- A self publishing e-commerce site for users to sell digital goods.

- A photo reviewing application that allows photographers to create clients and upload photos for their clients' approval.

- A desktop and mobile music player built using web technologies and Electron.

- A mental health check in application that allows you to keep tabs on your mental health.

The skills picked up on my development journey have enabled me to take on some pretty exciting projects, and I'm looking forward to diving into my next!
